# 🧬 Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprints

A deep learning-based system to **predict blood groups** from fingerprint patterns. This project explores the potential correlation between biometric fingerprint features and blood types, offering a **non-invasive, intelligent, and efficient** method for blood group prediction using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Resize, grayscale, and enhance fingerprint images.
   
2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Use CNN layers to extract features from fingerprint patterns.
   
3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a deep learning model to classify images into blood groups.
   
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
